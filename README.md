Thebod_Shippingrates
====================

Overview
--------
Simple configurable shippingrates for Magento.

This simple module lets you define as many shipping methods as you need, with an optional 'notification e-mail'.
Very useful for 'pickup-at-store' or if you need a few self-specified fixed rates shipping methods.
Tested on 1.6.1.0 (should work on Magento >= 1.4)
